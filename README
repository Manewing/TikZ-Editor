TIKZ EDITOR
===========

  Thank you for downloading TikZ Editor source repository.

  It is strongly recommended to install TikZ Editor using your OS's package
  system rather than using setup.py yourself. If you're using Mac OS X or Ubuntu
  Linux, please download the suitable package at:

    http://github.com/mickael-menu/TikZ-Editor


DEPENDENCIES
------------

  If you don't have this option, please make sure you satisfy TikZ Editor's
  dependencies:

   - Python version 2.6+ -- http://www.python.org/
   - PyQt version 4.3+ -- http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt
   - QScintilla 2.6+ -- http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/qscintilla
   - ImageMagick -- http://www.imagemagick.org/

  On Ubuntu Linux, you can install all these required packages using:

    sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-qscintilla2 imagemagick


INSTALLATION
------------

  You can test TikZ Editor directly from the current directory using:

    python tikz_editor.pyw

  Once you want to install it properly on your system, run:

    sudo make install


DEPLOYMENT
----------

  You may want to build distribution packages for a specific OS. The included
  Makefile provides facilities to automatically build distribution packages.

  DEPLOYMENT ON UBUNTU LINUX
  --------------------------
    Please make sure you have the following packages installed before going
    further:

      dh-make
      devscripts
      build-essential
      fakeroot
      python-setuptools

    You can now build the DEB package for Ubuntu Linux using:

      make deb

    Press Enter after the first step to start the building. After that, you
    will find the generated DEB package along a few other build files in the
    parent directory.


  DEPLOYMENT ON MAC OS X
  ----------------------
    Please make sure you have the following Python packages installed before
    going further:

      altgraph
      modulegraph

    Using MacPorts (www.macports.org), run this to install them:

      sudo port install py-altgraph py-modulegraph

    Moreover, you will need pyinstaller (www.pyinstaller.org) to build the APP
    bundle. The latest development version is recommended on a 64bit Mac OS X
    computer. Pyinstaller is not installable, so you have to keep it in a
    directory of your choice.

    You can now build the APP bundle, after setting the path to pyinstaller into
    the PYINSTALLER shell variable:

      export PYINSTALLER="/path/to/pyinstaller/"
      make app

    or directly:

      PYINSTALLER="/path/to/pyinstaller/" make app

    The Makefile will produce the APP bundle of the application in the dist/
    subdirectory. It will also build a DMG archive of the application containg
    the APP bundle and a symbolic link to the /Applications folder for
    distribution.


  DEPLOYMENT OF A SOURCE ARCHIVE
  ------------------------------
    To build a source archive for other platforms, stripped of all unnecessary
    files like README.md or the deployment directory, run:

      make tgz

    This will produce a TGZ archive file in the current directory.
